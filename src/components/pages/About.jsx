      <h2>About </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>BestCard</strong> is a modern web application designed to help users make smarter credit card choices. 
        We use intelligent algorithms and clean data design to simplify the complex process of finding, comparing, 
        and managing credit cards that fit your unique lifestyle and goals.
      </p>

      <h3>Story Behind BestCard</h3>
      <p>
        The idea for BestCard started with a simple question: <em>“Why is finding the right credit card so complicated?”</em>  
        We noticed that most comparison sites overwhelm users with jargon, unclear benefits, and ads that prioritize profits over people.  
        We decided to change that by building a transparent, a platform focused on clarity, trust, and personalization.
